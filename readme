This project aims to deliver a speech emotion recognition program using python's audio detection library Librosaa.
The project uses a dataset named "Ravedess", which contains numerous audio clips of various actors expressing different types of emotions 
such as "fear", "happy" ,"sad" etc.
Using Librosa, the emotion from the actor's speech is detected.
A histogram and a spectrogram have also been displayed for better analysis of the speeches.
Furthermore, we can use the NLP classifier module of python along with some others, to calculate the efficiency of predictions made by the program
for detecting emotions in the speeches.
